A calculator useful for playing the game ClickerHeroes

# Roadmap
The calculator is going to be doing a rough game simulation to come up with recommendations. For that to work, I need to come up with accurate approximations for DPS calculations, mob/boss health and gold drop rates and all of the other pieces that factor into typical gameplay.

The very first step is going to be getting a rough simulation done without factoring in any ancients.

Once I have a simulation completed, I'm going to be coming up with some factors for determining when the simulation should end and use that as an indication to the player when they should ascend.

From there I'll be adding support for ancients in the calculations, but this will probably come one at a time.

I'm going to tailor this to suit an idle type game play for now as that's my personal style. I'll be looking to have it more clicker friendly once it's generally useful and I can get some input from people who use auto-clickers or people who routinely do EDR style deep runs.
